A hot potato
A penny for your thoughts
Caught between two stools
Costs an arm and a leg
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Actions speak louder than words
Cry over spilt milk
Add insult to injury
An arm and a leg
Curiosity killed the cat
At the drop of a hat
Cut corners
Back to the drawing board
Cut the mustard
Ball is in your court
Devil's Advocate
Barking up the wrong tree
Don't count your chickens before the eggs have hatched
Don't give up the day job
Be glad to see the back of
Beat around the bush
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Best of both worlds
Elvis has left the building
Best thing since sliced bread
Bite off more than you can chew
Every cloud has a silver lining
Blessing in disguise
Far cry from
Burn the midnight oil
Feel a bit under the weather
Can't judge a book by its cover
Give the benefit of the doubt
Hear it on the grapevine
Off one's rocker
Hit the nail on the head
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
Hit the sack / sheets / hay
In the heat of the moment
Picture paints a thousand words
It takes two to tango
Piece of cake
Put wool over other people's eyes
Jump on the bandwagon
See eye to eye
Keep something at bay
Sit on the fence
Kill two birds with one stone
Last straw
Speak of the devil!
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Taste of your own medicine
Make a long story short
To hear something straight from the horse's mouth
Method to my madness
Not a spark of decency
Not playing with a full deck
Steal someone's thunder
Take with a grain of salt
Miss the boat
Whole nine yards
Wouldn't be caught dead
Your guess is as good as mine
