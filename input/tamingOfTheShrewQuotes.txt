Look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror
I'll not budge an inch
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en; In brief, sir, study what you most affect
There's small choice in rotten apples
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl!
Why, nothing comes amiss; so money comes withal
Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs
And do as adversaries do in law, Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness; And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor
and thereby hangs a tale
What, is the jay more precious than the lark,
Because his feathers are more beautiful?
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty
Such duty as the subject owes the prince, Even such a woman oweth to her husband
