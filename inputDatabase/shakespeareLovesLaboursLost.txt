Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives, 
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs 
And then grace us in the disgrace of death; 
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavour of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge,
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art
These are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
Painfully to pore upon a book 
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while 
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun,
That will not be deep-searched with saucy looks;
Small have continual plodders ever won,
Save base authority from others' books.
These earthly godfathers of Heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star,
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are
How well he's read, to reason against reading!
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain
Fashion's own knight
Assist me some extemporal god of rime, for I am sure I shall turn sonneter.
Devise, wit; write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio
Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
Not uttered by base sale of chapmen's tongues
A merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales,
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire
Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing
By my penny of observation
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her
He hath not fed of the dainties that are bred in a book;
he hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink
Old Mantuan! old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee not
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind
You two are book-men
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They are the ground, the books, the academes,
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain,
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain, and nourish all the world
He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument
Priscian! a little scratched, 't will serve
They have been at a great feast of languages, and stolen the scraps
In the posteriors of this day, which the rude multitude call the afternoon
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them
They have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it
When daisies pied and violets blue,
And lady-smocks all silver-white,
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men
The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You, that way: we, this way
