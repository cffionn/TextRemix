At least what's never had can't be lost, the masses,10,12,1
running, shouting now into the water wash over my sins?,10,15,1
of self stuck with innocent passage,6,9,1
a lullaby in the state of film and Advil,9,12,1
you but some alarmed pretender, I went on boulevard Madville,10,16,1
been incinerated, I've oft returned to mass attacking,8,15,1
of the wind be beneath my wings?,7,8,1
At least what's never had can't be lost, the rhythm of the plastic anthem,14,18,1
a lullaby in the very fabric,6,10,1
running, shouting now into the wind be beneath my wings?,10,14,1
At least what's never had can't be lost, the parish,10,12,1
